The install script for the server hasn't been written yet, so, to install it, run these commands manually, some of them as root.

How this works
==============

First, install a inetd/xinetd daemon, which runs a telnet server.
Then, change the login program used by telnet to a script that always logs you in as the same user.
Next, change /etc/shadow to set that user's password as empty. That way you're logged in right away after you connect, no password asked.
The user you're logged in as has ~.profile that invokes a chroot environment, where the server is run.

Create a user
su
useradd pipework
chsh pipework
	/bin/bash
mkdir ~pipework
chown pipework ~pipework

Copy files
# pr/archive/pipework/crazy_pipework/ is the path to the server files
su pipework
cp -r pr/archive/pipework/crazy_pipework/ ~
cp pr/archive/pipework/crazy_pipework/scripts/*.sh ~
cp pr/archive/pipework/crazy_pipework/scripts/*.txt ~

Set password to empty string
sed -i 's/^\(pipework:\)[^:]*/\1$1$VNMbpxGH$sew7cnwH9ixU.x27UbFNn./' /etc/shadow

Edit ~.profile
cat <<\eof >>~pipework/.profile
export XSID=`cut -d ' ' -f4 /proc/$PPID/stat`
export CHROOTUID=`id -u`
export CHROOTGID=`id -g`

stty susp undef
sudo ./chroot.sh
exit
eof

Edit /etc/sudoers
visudo

Defaults	env_keep+=XSID
Defaults	env_keep+=CHROOTUID
Defaults	env_keep+=CHROOTGID

pipework ALL=NOPASSWD: /home/pipework/chroot.sh

Create a chroot environment
su
./remake_chroot.sh
#FIXME: this is very slow

Install telnet
apt-get install telnetd

Edit fstab
/dev /home/pipework/chroot/dev none defaults,bind 0 0

Mount lib to lib64
cd /home/pipework/chroot/
mount --bind lib lib64

Copy the screen program
chown -R pipework chroot/home/.my-client
cp crazy_pipework/bin/py_curses.py chroot/home/.my-client/bin/py_curses.py

chown -R pipework home/
chown -R pipework crazy_pipework/log/
chown -R pipework crazy_pipework/pipe/
chown pipework crazy_pipework/
chown pipework crazy_pipework/curseserror 

If you run telnet through xinetd

cat <<\eof >/etc/xinetd.d/telnet 
service telnet
{
	disable  =  no
	socket_type  =  stream
	protocol = tcp
	port = 23 
	user = root
	group = root
	instances = UNLIMITED
	wait = no
	server = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
	server_args = -L /usr/local/bin/my-autologin
}
eof

And make sure your /etc/xinetd.conf has the following lines:

# Simple configuration file for xinetd
#
# Some defaults, and include /etc/xinetd.d/

defaults
{

# Please note that you need a log_type line to be able to use log_on_success
# and log_on_failure. The default is the following :
# log_type = SYSLOG daemon info
log_type = SYSLOG authpriv
log_type += FILE /var/log/xinetd
log_on_success = HOST PID DURATION USERID
log_on_failure = HOST ATTEMPT
cps = 10 30

}

includedir /etc/xinetd.d


If you have inetd, add to /etc/inetd.conf:

telnet		stream	tcp	nowait	root /usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/sbin/in.telnetd -L /usr/local/bin/my-autologin

Create login program to automatically log in as pipework user

cat <<\eof >/usr/local/bin/my-autologin 
#!/bin/sh
exec /bin/login -f pipework
eof
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/my-autologin 

Re-read inetd config:

kill -HUP `pidof inetd`

or

kill -HUP `pidof xinetd`
